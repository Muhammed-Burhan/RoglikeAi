# 🗡️ RogueLike Adventure ⚔️

A modern roguelike adventure game built with React featuring procedural level generation, progressive difficulty, and turn-based combat. Fight monsters, collect loot, level up, and survive as many floors as possible!

## 🎮 What is this game?

**RogueLike Adventure** is a classic dungeon crawler where you:
- **Explore** randomly generated dungeons 
- **Fight** monsters (Goblins → Orcs → Trolls → Dragons)
- **Collect** weapons, armor, health potions, and gold
- **Level up** your character to get stronger
- **Survive** as many floors as possible

Every playthrough is different with randomly generated levels!

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** = Move
- **I** = Open/Close Inventory  
- **R** = Restart (when dead)

### Game Symbols
- **`@`** = You (the hero)
- **`g,o,T,D`** = Enemies (Goblin, Orc, Troll, Dragon)
- **`H`** = Health Potion

- **`S`** = Shield (increases defense)  
- **`$`** = Gold
